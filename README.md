🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js 18+
Docker & Docker Compose
Git

Installation

Clone the repository

bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-awareness-app.git
cd phishing-awareness-app

Start the PostgreSQL database

bash docker compose up -d

Initialize the database

bash docker exec -i $(docker ps -qf "ancestor=postgres:15") psql -U appuser -d phishingapp < backend/init.sql
Alternative (if above fails):
bash # Via psql
psql -U appuser -d phishingapp -h localhost -f backend/init.sql

# Or via pgAdmin

# Import init.sql through pgAdmin GUI

Install and start the backend

bash cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
Backend runs on: http://localhost:5000

Install and start the frontend

bash cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5173

Open the app
Navigate to http://localhost:5173 in your browser

🔒 Security Features
Authentication & Authorization

JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
Role-based access control (USER/ADMIN)
Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds + salt)

Attack Prevention

SQL Injection: Parameterized queries with pg library ($1, $2, ...)
XSS: HTTP-only cookies prevent JavaScript access to tokens
CSRF: SameSite cookie attribute

Data Protection

Passwords never stored in plain text
JWT tokens expire after 1 hour
GDPR considerations implemented (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f - legitimate interest)

🎓 Development Process
This project was developed using Agile methodology:

Iterative development in sprints
MVP first (basic quiz functionality)
Feature additions (badges, admin panel)
Continuous improvements based on feedback

Testing Approach

Manual E2E testing
Cross-browser compatibility testing
Security testing (SQL injection, XSS attempts)

🚧 Future Improvements

Automated testing (Jest, Cypress)
HTTPS/SSL implementation
Email verification
Password reset functionality
Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Advanced analytics dashboard
Question categories and difficulty levels
Timed quiz mode
Export user data (GDPR compliance)
Multilingual support
